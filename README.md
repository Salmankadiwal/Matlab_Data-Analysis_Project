Data Set Used:

IRIS DATA SET

Creator : R.A. Fisher
Donor  :  Michael Marshall



Data Set Information:

The data set contains 3 classes of 50 instances each, where each class refers to a type of iris plant.

Predicted attribute: Three Class of iris plant.

Attribute Information:

1.	Sepal length in cm
2.	Sepal width in cm
3.	Petal length in cm
4.	Petal width in cm
 
5. Output Classes:
 
- Iris Setosa                Class-1
- Iris Versicolour           Class-2
- Iris Virginica             Class-3

 

There are in total 50 data elements in each class, thereby making a total of 150 data rows/elements.

For data analysis, only top 10 data rows from each class is used.


Explanation of the project:

-The sepal length and width and Petal length and width are the features that are used to predict the plant classes.

-The mean, max, min and variance were computed. 

-Plotted classes vs all species length and width (Sepal and Petal) i.e., classes to examine 3 species length and width (sepal and petal).

-A correlation matrix is also computed, and histogram is used to understand frequency of each classes.
